1. Download the image file
2. Run the `strings` command on the `anonymous-250.jpg`
3. See the false flag `flag{you_think_this_is_the_flag?}`? No that's not the flag, there is a download link to a text file
4. The text file reveals:
```
The person began shouting
heredity! and she was isistent on
escalating this matter to the police! From far, I can see the
flag waving past the winds, yeah quite
lame, if you ask me, it was just a short description of the
atmosphere around me. Anyway that lady was out of her mind. I wanted to
go up to her and slap her hideous and horrendous
inanimate attitude out of her!
She was still shouting but I tried my best to keep my cool, but on the inside, I felt
hell within me, as if some
elephant wanted to fuck with me! As if the elephant, with its
long trunk just poked me and I FEEL HELL UNLEASH WITHIN ME.
lastly, I finished up telling the story to
Owen. And we continued drinking coffee, laughing at each other's imaginary story
```
5. Connect the dots by using the first letter of each sentence and it should read out `theflagishello`. Voila!
